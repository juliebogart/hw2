  <p>In 2015, Julie's love of international travel took her to three countries:
    <ul>
      <li>Portugal
      <li>Russia
      <li>Brazil
    </ul>
    Below are photo highlights of her travels. </p>

  <h3>Portugal</h3>
  <p>Julie and her two siblings took a trip to Southern Portugal for
    wine tasting and time at the beach in September 2015.</p>

  <p>After wine tasting in Southern Portugal, the siblings drove to a beautiful
    city called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sintra">Sintra</a>, which
    is just north of Lisbon. Here, they went to the Sintra Castle which looked
    like it belonged in a Disney movie.

  <h3>Russia</h3>
  <p>Julie and her sister found a $400 round trip flight to Moscow on Singapore
  air, and randomly booked a trip to Russia in October 2015. They first went to Moscow,
  followed by St. Petersburg.

  <p>After exploring snowy cold Moscow, they took a train to St. Petersburg. St.
    Petersburg was less "Russian" and more European looking than Moscow.

  <h3>Brazil</h3>
  <p>Following tradition, Julie, her sister, and a group of friends spent
    Christmas and New Years in a warm climate - this time Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
    Upon arrival, the Airbnb host had coconuts to drink waiting for us. It was paradise
    arriving in a warm climate to a cool coconut after a long flight.

  <p>One of our favorite foods was an "acai" bowl, which is similar to a smoothie
    but made with one of Brazil's superfood berries from the Amazon, the acai.
